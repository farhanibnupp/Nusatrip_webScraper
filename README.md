# Nusatrip_webScraper
This website crawls data from competitor OTAs, gathering details like platform name, departure date, destination airport, airline, flight code, cabin class, departure and arrival times, transit count, routes, flight duration, and rates. I contributed to the UI development with React.js and handled data crawling on the Traveloka platform.
